- 👋 Hi, I’m @razi1998
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on Web Applications on reactJs
- 🌱 I have learned ReactJs and React Native
- 🌱 I have worked with MaterialUI and also have an experience on pre-written components customization.
- 🌱 I have worked on NextJS with graphQL API and apollo client
- 🌱 I mostly focus on front-end because it seems more intresting to me.
<!-- - 🌱 And Now I am currently working on a project based on React typescript and FeatherJS REST API integration -->
- 📫 If you want a front end developer to collaborate reach me @ rajivp332@gmail.com
